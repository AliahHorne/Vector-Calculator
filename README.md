# Vector-Calculator

## Points:
150 (+50 pt. Extra Credit Opportunity)

## Due Date:
???? ??th, 2024

## Goal:
To create a C# class capable of representing Vectors and performing the Vector operations that we learn about in class.

## Learning Targets:
Identify common types of Vectors (Zero, Parallel, Unit, Opposite, Equal)
Calculate basic Vector operations (Addition, Subtraction, & Scaling)
Calculate the Negation of a Vector
Calculate the Magnitude of a Vector
Calculate the Normalized form of a Vector
Calculate the Dot Product of two Vectors
Calculate the Cross Product of two Vectors
Calculate the Angle between two Vectors
Calculate the Projection of one Vector onto another
Calculate the Reflection of one Vector across another

## Instructions:
Start by creating a C# class that represents a 3D Vector. This must have an X, a Y, and a Z (think about what data type best represents these: An int? A float? A string? A bool? Could you use an array for this?). After you do this, you must create a constructor that creates a Vector given the values. Then, you must override the ToString() method to allow the user to print the Vector using the format “[x, y, z]”. After you confirm that this works, create methods for each of the math concepts we learned in class. The following are cases you must make methods for (the grading/milestones). There are a total of 12 methods you need to implement.
